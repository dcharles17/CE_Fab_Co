5. Make it easy: Send direct links, don't make customers search for you

**Review Link Format:**
`https://g.page/r/[YOUR_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID]/review`

**Target:** Aim for 25+ reviews in the first 3 months, then 5-10 new reviews per month.

   - Years of experience
   - Certifications and qualifications
   - Why customers should choose you
   - 500-800 words minimum
