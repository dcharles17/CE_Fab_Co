                    <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
                    <p>We accept cash, checks, and all major credit cards. For larger projects, we typically require a deposit to begin work (usually 50%) with the balance due upon completion. We'll outline payment terms clearly in your project quote. For commercial clients, we can discuss invoicing and payment schedules that work for your Cache County business.</p>
